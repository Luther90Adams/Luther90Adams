## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a data engineer with a solid foundation in designing, building, and optimizing data workflows that support business intelligence and analytics. My expertise lies in working with SQL, crafting efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and managing data infrastructure in modern cloud-based environments like Snowflake. This repository showcases a range of projects that reflect both my technical skills and my passion for clean, scalable, and maintainable data solutions.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed and maintained data pipelines that handle large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. I enjoy the challenge of transforming raw data into meaningful insights by applying best practices in data modeling, quality assurance, and performance tuning. Whether it's optimizing a slow-running query or designing a robust ETL pipeline from scratch, I take pride in delivering solutions that are reliable and efficient.

My experience spans industries and includes working cross-functionally with analysts, data scientists, and product teams to deliver high-impact data products. I'm always looking to learn new tools and techniques in the rapidly evolving data ecosystem, and this repository is a reflection of that continuous learning mindset.

In this space, youâ€™ll find sample ETL frameworks, Snowflake-related best practices, SQL utilities, and general data engineering workflows. Everything here is open for collaboration and feedbackâ€”whether you're a fellow data engineer, an aspiring professional, or someone just curious about data infrastructure.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something helpful or inspiring here. Feel free to fork, contribute, or connectâ€”thereâ€™s always something new to build and discover in the world of data.
